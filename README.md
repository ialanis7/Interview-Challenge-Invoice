# Interview-Challenge-Invoice
This was a technical assesment for a company that dealt with a large amount of customers and customer information on a daily basis. I was given roughly a week time to complete this assessment.

I have two folders with what the company provided and what I supplied to the company. The assignment was split into three parts. 

The first part I had to read and parse the contents from billfile.xml and output to the format which is given in BillsOutput.txt. Then export to the Billfile-mmddyyyy.rpt which is in my "My Solutions folder".

The second part is reading the rpt file "BillFile.rpt" and output to the access database which is in my "Given files from company" folder to its corresponding tables and fields.

Lastly, connect to the "Billing" database and retrieve all the records from both tables and export to a csv file.
